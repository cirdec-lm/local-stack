# Backend Local stack

This is the backbone for the webservices I test. They communicate via the docker network called "veille".
* `docker network create veille`

In this local stack, there is a reverse proxy that parse the url and do some redirection based on subdirectory name. The subdirectory must be the container name that you want to access.

In order to match the pattern expected, you must do the main request with the url 'veille.bzh'.
In your '/etc/hosts', add the following line:
* `127.0.0.1 veille.bzh`

The webservices that can be used are the following:

* gateway
* users
